# DEGA ISPO

Welcome to the official repository of the DEGA ISPO (Initial Staking Pool Offering). This initiative is part of the DEGA ecosystem, designed to integrate with the Ethereum blockchain's staking mechanism via the Lido project. 

## Overview

The DEGA ISPO features a Solidity-based smart contract for interacting with the Lido staking pool. It enables users to deposit their stETH tokens, aligning with the DEGA project's goals. This repository is intended to showcase the smart contract code, detail the audit processes it has undergone, and provide insights into the project's structure and objectives.

### Key Features

- **stETH Deposits**: Allows participants to deposit stETH tokens from the Lido project into the DEGA ISPO contract.
- **Flexible Withdrawals**: Offers users the ability to withdraw their staked assets at any time, ensuring flexibility and control over their contributions.

## Smart Contract Code

The DEGA ISPO is powered by a Solidity smart contract, designed to manage the deposit of stETH tokens efficiently and securely. The contract's code emphasizes security, efficiency, and transparency.

You can find the smart contract code in the `DegaISPO.sol` file of this repository.

## Audit Report

To uphold the highest standards of security, the DEGA ISPO contract has undergone a thorough audit. The audit report, conducted by [STATEMIND](https://statemind.io/) auditing firm, is available in the `DEGA_ETH_ISPO_Audit.pdf` file. It covers security assessments, efficiency evaluations, and the measures taken to address any identified issues.
